Welcome to the **DS-PROBLEMS** repository! This project is dedicated to solving various data structures problems, with solutions implemented in Java.

## Overview

This repository serves as a continuously evolving collection of data structure problems and their solutions. It is designed to help individuals enhance their understanding and proficiency in data structures by providing practical examples and explanations.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each corresponding to a specific data structure. As of now, the following directories are included:

- `LinkedList/`: Contains problems and solutions related to linked lists.
- `Stack/`: Contains problems and solutions related to stacks.

Each directory includes Java files that address specific problems associated with the respective data structure.
